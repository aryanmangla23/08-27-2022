Woke up at 6:30. Made food and tea. Meeting at 11-12. Haircut. Came back at 1. Showered and cleaned up my beard. Fell asleep and woke up at 5:20. Worked till 1. No feelings to accentuate for today.

All the worldâ€™s a stage,

And all the men and women merely players

They have their exits and their entrances

And one teen in his time plays many parts

His act being seven chapters:



At first, a stranger among the usual crowd

Like strangers to friends

One obstacle, a thousand pieces

**To blindly lose himself.**



The pretense of societal norms

A lost sheep following similar tracks

An armor over his soul

**To blindly lose himself.**



Head in the blue sky

Smiling around adversity at the mere thought

Understand true anxiety

**To blindly lose himself.**



The blue yet cloudy sky

Arrow struck

Filled with sorrow and uncertainty

**To blindly lose himself.**



Looking deep within the cloudy sky

Sworn to clear up

**To work on himself.**



Completion of a twenty year dream

A prestigious title to make a difference in the world

**To heal people.**



Left my searching behind for you to find me

A soulmate. A best friend.

**To live in the moment.**
